# ID1201_assignment6
This is an assignemnt for the course ID1201, Algorithms and Data Structures, at KTH Royal Institute of Techonology. 
This assignment is about implementing and exploring the binary tree structure.

## How run

This is an example of how to compile and test this project.

```bash
mvn clean && mvn compile && mvn test
```

In main, we have implemented a benchmark that tests both the BinaryTree and a sorted array by searching a random data in them, see [Main.java](https://github.com/Lellalu/ID1201_assignment6/blob/main/src/main/java/se/kth/id1201/Main.java) 
for more details. To run this:

```bash
mvn exec:java 
```
